You may ask about 10900k But this project was started in 2019 and at that time 10th gen did not see the light. In 2019, 9900k was the best choice for gaming without any hesitation offering top-notch gaming performance.\n\n![alter-text](/images/post/processor_1.png)\n*core i9 9900k*\n\n> “As the very purpose of my build is only playing games rather than doing other things,and Intel serves this purpose very well,it is enough for me. all of you know very well that the GAMING performance of intel is still better than ryzen. Because i can get better gaming performance, that’s why i have chosen intel.”\n\n#### MotherBoard\n\nFor the motherboard, the owner has selected MSI MEG Z390 GODLIKE. Both in terms of VRM performance and design, undoubtedly this is one of the best motherboards around and the perfect choice for this special build.\n\n![alter-text](/images/post/motherboard2.png)\n*MSI MEG Z390 GODLIKE*\n\n#### Casing:\n\n![alter-text](/images/post/casing1.png)\n*Beauty and the Beast- Cougar ConquerE*\n\nCougar Conquer has been used in this build. This case does not need any description. It has created its own position because of its unique design, build quality, and look. Many of us know that it does not come in ready to run state, rather this case needs to be assembled manually.\n\n#### Graphic Card\n\nThe 3000USD worth beast Colorful IGame Geforce RTX 2080ti Kudan V has been used in this build. This is a limited edition card and there are many more elements of this card to talk about. Firstly, this is a limited edition card. It’s too expensive. Starting from the design, build to the cooling system, everything is unique of this GPU. This GPU comes with hybrid cooling.

For a enthusiast grade special project, nothing could be more perfect than a GPU like this, a special edition graphics card. You will do feel proud when you are the only one who owns this card in the whole country just like the owner of this build-\n\n> The feeling of Owning the one and only unit of a product in the whole country is really different, I can say that maybe I don’t have a Leopard, but surely i have a Kudan\n\n\n\n![alter-text](/images/post/grapic_card_2.png)\n*Geforce RTX 2080ti Kudan V*\n\n<Youtube id=\"cqvCEwq1vQI\" title=\"Play:Youtube\"/>\n\n\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"6000 USD SteamBoy - A Gaming PC Build from Renaissance ft Geforce RTX Kudan","date":"2025-02-01T15:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/post/post-7.png","categories":["pc build"],"featured":false,"draft":false},"slug":"post-15","content":"\n\nAbout PC Builder Bangladesh\nPC Builder Bangladesh is the first video based podcast.

It is just a 50$ step up from last year’s model, rounding up at 700$.\nThe monitor features a 1440p IPS display just like the previous year’s model, but Corsair has managed to give the display a refresh rate of 240 Hz, which is a good step up from the 32QHD165. The display is VESA DisplayHDR 600 rated and has Samsung’s Quantum Dot technology, which, according to Corsair, filters the LED backlight through millions of variable-sized crystals to improve color accuracy. Corsair claims that the display provides 100% sRGB, 100% Adobe RGB, and 98% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage.\nFor the ports, this one has two HDMI 2.1s, two USB Type-C, a display port 1.4, and an additional USB 3.1 charging hub with two type-A ports. Interestingly enough, this one also has 3.5 mm audio out.\nIf Corsair’s claims are correct, this monitor might be a good choice for streamers and content creators who focus on competitive, and/or fast-paced titles.\nSadly, however, this one has a rather simple stand rather than the one in the other monitors which looks much better.\n\n#### XENEON 32UHD144\n\nThe 32UHD144 is where things get interesting. This one is a 32 inch monitor with a 4k 144 Hz display. This one costs a thousand bucks, which, unlike the previous 32QHD240, is rather cheap for a monitor with its specs.\nSimilar to the QHD240, Corsair is claiming that the display provides 100% sRGB and 100% Adobe RGB, and the selection of ports remains the same. The same goes for the Quantum Dot technology and VESA DisplayHDR 600 rating.\nAll in all, this one seems to be a good monitor for gamers and professionals alike. From the looks of it, it feels like this monitor will be popular among streamers and content creators alike, considering this one is supposed to have a display suitable for editing, color grading, and gaming at higher frame rates at the same time.\n\nEven though the monitors seem promising enough, Corsair’s business practices with these monitors remind me of Apple. There is an option to purchase the monitor without the stand, and that will save you 50$ and 100$ for the 32QHD240 and the 32UHD144 respectively. Although it’s way better than having to pay a thousand bucks for a simple monitor stand, there are much cheaper VESA mounts in the market that do a better job of holding the monitor in place and provide better adjustability. It is weird to see Corsair charging such high prices for these stands which are fairly basic.\n\nIt is great to see Corsair in the market for gaming monitors. Although the prices right now are a bit high with the 1440p variants, they are doing fairly good with the 4k model. It will be interesting to see what Corsair does in the future with their monitors, but till then, let’s enjoy these monitors. Also, kudos to Corsair for having a good naming pattern instead of a bash on the keyboard.\n\n> It will be interesting to see what Corsair does in the future with their monitors, but till then, let’s enjoy these monitors.
