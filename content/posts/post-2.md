*Beauty and the Beast- Cougar ConquerE*

Cougar Conquer has been used in this build. This case does not need any description. It has created its own position because of its unique design, build quality, and look. Many of us know that it does not come in ready to run state, rather this case needs to be assembled manually.

#### Graphic Card

The 3000USD worth beast Colorful IGame Geforce RTX 2080ti Kudan V has been used in this build. This is a limited edition card and there are many more elements of this card to talk about. Firstly, this is a limited edition card. It’s too expensive. Starting from the design, build to the cooling system, everything is unique of this GPU. This GPU comes with hybrid cooling. Another interesting thing you can notice if you look at the build that is the color scheme of the GPU has been perfectly matched with the theme of STEAMBOY Build.

Thus, it further increases the beauty of the build. In other words, this is the perfect build to represent this special Graphics card. There are very few builds which have made the best use of this gorgeous looking Graphics card other than SteamBoy.  For a enthusiast grade special project, nothing could be more perfect than a GPU like this, a special edition graphics card.
